<center>My name is Sanusi Umar-Farouk Bisoye, i'm a student of Kwara state University, Malete, doing<BR />
a bachelor's degree program in computer science. I resumed here in 200L via direct entry using my IJMB certification.<BR />
I hail from Iloffa, kwara State but was born in Lagos and lived most of my life there,i'm from a family of six ,<BR />
 my two parents and my three older sisters and I. i percieve my self as an easy going person.<BR />
calm and gentle but playful atimes. During my spartime i like to work with my computer, i'm a graphics designer,<br />
so most times when i'm on my computer i'm working on a design. I guess in the real sense i usually don't have spare times.<BR />
